## Option 3
The third option is to implement the official marketplace of the application. The marketplace will allow sellers to list their products and customers to purchase them. 

Looking for an example? Review the listing pages for any online store. 


Reminder: You can assume that only one user is accessing the application at a time. A seller might log in, list a product, then log out. A customer could then log in and purchase the item. 

## Instructions to run the project
From the root directory of the project, compile Runner.java and then run it which will launch the main application.
